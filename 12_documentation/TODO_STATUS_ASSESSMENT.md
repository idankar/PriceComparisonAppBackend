- 🔴 **PHASE 3 (Data Quality):** NOT STARTED - Significant work needed

## 🚀 PHASE 1: GOOD PHARM COVERAGE FIX

### Current State:
| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Good Pharm Active Products | 3,331 | 11,776 | ❌ 28.3% |
| Super-Pharm Active Products | 17,575 | 18,882 | ⚠️ 93.1% |
| Be Pharm Active Products | 9,587 | 9,690 | ✅ 98.9% |

### Task Status:

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Database Backup
**Status:** NOT COMPLETED (Recommended before proceeding)
- [ ] Backup canonical_products table
- [ ] Backup retailer_products table
- [ ] Document current counts

#### ⚠️ Task 1.2: Create Good Pharm Entries from Orphaned Products
**Status:** NOT APPLICABLE
- **Finding:** All orphaned products (7,601) are already marked as `is_active = FALSE`
- **No action needed:** Zero orphaned active products with Good Pharm pricing exist

#### 🟡 Task 1.3: Create Good Pharm Entries from Super-Pharm
**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE
- **Potential Products:** 1,991 products
- **Expected Impact:** +1,991 Good Pharm products (not 5,584 as originally estimated)
- [ ] Test query on small sample (LIMIT 10)
- [ ] Run full INSERT query
- [ ] Verify count increase

#### 🟡 Task 1.4: Create Good Pharm Entries from Be Pharm
**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE
- **Potential Products:** 2,678 products
- **Expected Impact:** +2,678 Good Pharm products (not 3,161 as originally estimated)
- [ ] Test query on small sample
- [ ] Run full INSERT query
- [ ] Verify final Good Pharm count

#### ❌ Task 1.5: Validation & Testing
**Status:** BLOCKED - Cannot validate until Tasks 1.3 & 1.4 complete
- **Projected Final Good Pharm Count:** 3,331 + 1,991 + 2,678 = **8,000** (not 11,776)
- **Gap Analysis:** Missing ~3,776 products from original estimate
- **Likely Cause:** Good Pharm may have products not in Super-Pharm or Be Pharm catalogs

### ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING - PHASE 1:
The original estimate of 11,776 Good Pharm products **cannot be achieved** with current data sources. Maximum achievable is ~8,000 products (68% of target).

**Recommendation:**
1. Execute Tasks 1.3 & 1.4 to get to 8,000 products
2. Consider scraping Good Pharm directly to fill the 3,776 product gap
3. Re-evaluate if 8,000 products is acceptable coverage
