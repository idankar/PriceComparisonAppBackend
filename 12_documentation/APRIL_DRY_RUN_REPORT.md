## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

### Minor Issue: Stock Quantity Not Captured

**Impact:** Low (non-critical field)

**Details:** The `stock_quantity` field was null for all products. The hidden `<div>` containing stock data exists in the HTML but was not successfully extracted.

**Root Cause:** CSS selector for stock div needs refinement. The stock information is in a hidden div with pattern: `<div class="d-none" id="stock{ID}">{quantity}</div>`

**Recommended Fix:** Update the stock extraction logic to use a more specific selector or fallback method.

**Workaround:** Stock availability can be inferred from product page or left as optional enrichment field.
