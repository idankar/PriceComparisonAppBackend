Deactivate XML-Only Products

This script marks all products that were created by government XML parsers
(source_retailer_id IS NULL) as inactive. These products should only be
activated when commercial scrapers find and enrich them with images and categories.

Strategy:
1. Mark all NULL-source products as inactive
2. Report statistics on what was deactivated
3. Provide recommendations for ETL script updates

1. UPDATE GOVERNMENT ETL SCRIPTS:
   - When creating new canonical_products entries, set is_active = FALSE
   - Only set is_active = TRUE if the product already exists
   - This prevents non-pharma items from appearing in the app

   Example code change in ETL scripts:
   ```python
   INSERT INTO canonical_products (barcode, name, brand, is_active)
   VALUES (%s, %s, %s, FALSE)  -- Changed from TRUE to FALSE
   ON CONFLICT (barcode) DO NOTHING
   ```

2. UPDATE COMMERCIAL SCRAPERS:
   - When scraping products, ALWAYS set is_active = TRUE
   - This activates products when commercial data is found
   - Already implemented in Super-Pharm scraper (verify others)

   Example:
   ```python
   INSERT INTO canonical_products (barcode, name, brand, image_url, category, source_retailer_id, is_active)
   VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, TRUE)
   ON CONFLICT (barcode) DO UPDATE SET
       image_url = EXCLUDED.image_url,
       category = EXCLUDED.category,
       source_retailer_id = EXCLUDED.source_retailer_id,
       is_active = TRUE  -- Activate when commercial data is found
   ```

3. VERIFY PRICE CALCULATION:
   - Ensure lowest_price calculation only considers active products
   - Check that API endpoints filter by is_active = TRUE (already implemented)

4. CONSIDER FUTURE BACKFILL:
   - Once commercial scrapers are updated, you can run image/category backfill
   - Backfill script should set is_active = TRUE when it successfully finds data
