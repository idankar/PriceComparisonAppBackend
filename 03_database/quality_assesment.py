        You are a Senior Data Quality Analyst with 30 years of experience, specializing in retail and e-commerce data.
        Your task is to provide a detailed analysis and give a final "green light" recommendation for a product dataset.

        I have two datasets:
        1. "Golden Standard Data": A clean, well-structured sample from the market leader, Super-Pharm.
        2. "Candidate Data": A sample from another retailer (Good Pharm) that needs to be compared against the golden standard.

        Here is the Golden Standard Data (from Super-Pharm):
        ```json
        {golden_json}
        ```

        Here is the Candidate Data (from Good Pharm):
        ```json
        {candidate_json}
        ```

        Please provide a report in Markdown format that covers the following points:

        1.  **Completeness:** Are there any obvious missing fields in the Candidate Data? How does its completeness compare to the Golden Standard?
        2.  **Clarity & Fuzziness:** Analyze the `name` and `brand` fields in the Candidate Data. Are the names clear and descriptive, or are they full of abbreviations, internal codes, or other noise compared to the Golden Standard? Provide 2-3 specific examples of "fuzzy" or unclear names.
        3.  **Uniformity:** Assess the consistency of the Candidate Data. Are the naming conventions, capitalization, and formatting for brand and name consistent? How does this uniformity compare to the Golden Standard?
        4.  **Actionable Recommendations:** Based on your analysis, what are the top 2-3 most critical actions that need to be taken to improve the Candidate Data's quality before it can be used for reliable price comparison?
        5.  **Final Verdict (The "Green Light"):** Conclude with a clear verdict. Is this Candidate Data ready for production use ("Green Light"), does it need minor, automatable cleanup ("Yellow Light"), or does it require significant manual review and cleaning ("Red Light")? Justify your verdict.
